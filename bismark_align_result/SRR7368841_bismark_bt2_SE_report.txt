Bismark report for: SRR7368841.fastq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/yakamozchan/project/mouse/genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	100336985
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	61392069
Mapping efficiency:	61.2%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	33028712
Sequences did not map uniquely:	5916204
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	17

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	30797783	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	30594269	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
