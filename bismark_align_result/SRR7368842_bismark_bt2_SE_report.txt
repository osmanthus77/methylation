Bismark report for: SRR7368842.fastq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/yakamozchan/project/mouse/genome_chr19/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	184621978
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	4949440
Mapping efficiency:	2.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	174292300
Sequences did not map uniquely:	5380238
